pandas-cookbook
===============

Recipes for using Python's pandas library.

This is an alpha cookbook! Chapters will be added here as. Let me know if you have suggestions, or if there are bugs

It comes with batteries (data) included, so you can try out all the examples right away.

Chapters
========

[Chapter 1: Reading from a CSV](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/jvns/pandas-cookbook/blob/master/cookbook/Chapter%201%20-%20Reading%20from%20a%20CSV.ipynb)



Installation
============

You'll need an up-to-date version of IPython Notebook (>= 1.0) and pandas (>=0.12) for this to work properly

You can get these using `pip`:

```
pip install ipython pandas numpy
```

Alternatively, I use and recommend [Anaconda](https://store.continuum.io/), which will give you everything you need. It's free and open source.

Once you have pandas and IPython, you can get going!

```
git clone
https://github.com/jvns/pandas-cookbook.git
cd pandas-cookbook/cookbook
ipython notebook --pylab inline
```

A tab should open up in your browser at `http://localhost:8888`

Happy pandas!
